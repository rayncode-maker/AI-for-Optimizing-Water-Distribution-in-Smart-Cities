# AI for Optimizing Water Distribution in Smart Cities

## Week 2 Submission: Data Synthesis and Preprocessing

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered system to optimize water distribution in urban environments, addressing challenges like water loss, high energy costs, and inefficient demand response. This repository contains the work for **Week 2**, focused on creating a synthetic dataset and preparing it for machine learning model development.

### Objectives for Week 2
1.  **Data Synthesis:** Generate a realistic, multi-year synthetic dataset simulating daily urban water demand and influencing factors.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Clean, normalize, and prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform initial analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the generated data.

### Methodology
1.  **Synthetic Data Generation:**
    *   A time series dataset was generated for the dates `2020-01-01` to `2022-12-31`.
    *   **Features Generated:**
        *   `population`: Simulated city population.
        *   `temperature_c`: Daily average temperature.
        *   `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, `is_holiday`: Temporal features.
        *   `rainfall_mm`: Simulated daily rainfall.
    *   **Target Variable:**
        *   `water_demand_ML`: Daily water demand in Megaliters. Calculated with a base demand, seasonality, temperature correlation, and random noise.

2.  **Preprocessing Steps:**
    *   **Handling Missing Values:** Checked for and confirmed no missing values in the synthetic data.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Created `month` and `day_of_year` features from the datetime index.
    *   **Train-Test Split:** Data was split chronologically (80% train, 20% test) to preserve the time-series order.
    *   **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### Files in this Submission
*   `week2_data_synthesis_and_preprocessing.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data generation, EDA, and preprocessing.
*   `water_demand_timeseries.png`: (Generated by the notebook) A plot showing the generated water demand over time.
*   `processed_data/`: Folder containing the preprocessed datasets ready for model training in Week 3.
    *   `X_train.csv`, `X_test.csv`: Scaled feature sets for training and testing.
    *   `y_train.csv`, `y_test.csv`: Target variable (water demand) for training and testing.

### Tools & Technologies Used
*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
*   **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
*   **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

### How to Run This Code
1.  Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
3.  Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
4.  Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook week2_data_synthesis_and_preprocessing.ipynb
    ```
5.  Run the cells sequentially to generate the data and see the outputs.

### Next Steps (Week 3)
The next phase of the project will use this preprocessed data to:
*   Build a **Random Forest Regression** model for water demand forecasting.
*   Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
*   Begin developing the optimization algorithm for resource allocation.
